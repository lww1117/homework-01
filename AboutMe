Hi, I am Thida! If all goes well I should be graduating in December with a BS in Comp Sci with three minors, Chinese,
Math, and History. I enjoy reading, mainly fiction, as well as watching shows in my spare time. I like to binge so I
start reading/watching a lot of different things at once. I work as a student technician under Classroom Technology.
I help the teachers with their tech issues(hardware) within the classroom. After I graduate while trying to find a job
in the field I plan on honing my foreign language skills and attempt to be a translator.

I am, I assume like many here, a Computer Science major. I am the youngest of four, and the most curious. 
Finding ways to take things apart into their component pieces, but not finding how to put them back together.
I have gotten into fountin pens recently, preferring Kaweco pens.
The type of hobby that I could not recommend unless spending hours tring to fix something that might be broken seems fun.
But generaly I play video games in my free time: Bioshock, Hades, The Outer Worlds, and CyberPunk 2077 to name a few.
Also I am tring to read through Terry Pratchett's Discworld books.
